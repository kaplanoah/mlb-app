// Keeps what player and roster sheets show, so a tap reads only the store and never waits on the

// and every team's games as a game ends, each team's roster every few hours, the league's list of
// every player once a day, and who ESPN lists as out on each team still playing every hour. It
// keeps each feed trimmed to the columns the sheets read, and saves only the documents that
// changed: each team's roster, each player's numbers, and the season's ranked numbers, which go
// last, so a season that has them is whole. Each run also fills one season the store keeps from
// before the current one, newest first, and a filled season is never read again, since a past
// season doesn't change, unless the sheets come to read a column it was filled without. Each run
// ends by saving how it went in `players/status`, with how often a sheet had to read the league
// for a player the store hadn't saved.
