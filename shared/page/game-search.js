// Reading a search of a season's games, like "Liberty at Dream", "Dream in NY", or "Liberty this
// weekend", into what each word asks of a game, finding the games that ask fits, and saying how it
// read the words. A league hands it what differs: its teams, places, rounds, and example searches,
// any groups of teams and starters it has, and how to read one of its games. Everything runs on the phone, from the season the page already
// holds, so a search never waits on the network. Runs in the page and in Node, so it uses no DOM.
//
// Joining words decide roles: "A at B" and "A @ B" have A visiting B, while "A B", "A vs B", and
// "A and B" find their games either way, and "A or B" either team's. "In" takes a place or a month,
// and a game is where its arena is, so "home" is a team's own arena and a home game the league plays
// at a neutral site is left out and named. Every condition must hold, and "next" and "last" then
// pick from what's left. A game whose time isn't set yet counts in a search of its day, and in a
// search for a time of day it's listed by date with the rest and counted apart, since it may yet fit.
// A word two teams share, like "Sox", finds either's games, and a starter's name finds the games he's
// named to start, his next only once it's announced.
