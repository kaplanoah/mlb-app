Private web pages that follow a league all year, one app per league. Each
app is its own page and Cloudflare Worker, in its own folder under `apps/`, and
they share code in `shared/` and the tooling that builds, tests, and deploys
them.

| App  | Folder       | Worker     |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------- |
| MLB  | `apps/mlb/`  | `mlb-app`  |
| WNBA | `apps/wnba/` | `wnba-app` |

### MLB

A private web page that follows the MLB season, from spring training through the
World Series. It shows the standings, the postseason bracket (projected from the
standings until the field is set), your ranking of who you want to win the World
Series, each team's
previous, current and next game with its starting pitchers, the All-Star Game, and scores
that update automatically. Tap a team's name for its sheet: its place in each race, its next game, how far
it's gone in the postseason, and every World Series it has won. Tap the rest of a game to
compare its starters: how they rank among the season's qualified starters,
what they throw, and how their last starts went. A game later today whose club hasn't named
its starter says "Still TBD" and opens to who started for that club lately and how rested each
would be.

A Cloudflare Worker serves the page, and each device keeps its own ranking. It also reads MLB
on its own, every 30 seconds during games while the page is open and a little
less often while it isn't, so the standings and updates stay current even with
the page closed, and sends the page each new score. Saved to an iPhone's home
screen, the page opens full screen like an app, and can send a notification
when something happens to a team in your ranking.

### WNBA

A private web page that follows the WNBA season. It shows the playoff bracket,
every game of the season, the All-Star Game too, from opening day to the last, under a strip of its days, with live
scores and clocks, and the league and conference standings with
the playoff line and, once the field is set, each team's first round and where its run stands. Tap a team's name or dot anywhere, even inside a game, for its season: its
conference, seed, and record, its scoring, home and road records, top scorer,
titles, and how far it got in the playoffs. Tap a game for its details: which
channels it's on, or was; once it starts, its points by quarter, a chart
of the lead through the game, the two
teams' stats side by side, and each team's top scorers; before it does, the two
teams' meetings this season, how their seasons compare, and each team's leading
scorers. On a phone or tablet, an Updates box under the tabs lists each playoff
game that ended since you last dismissed it, and where its series stands, and
under New in the app, any feature worth a note; each device keeps its own
dismissal. It follows the phone's dark or light setting, or
the one you pick in its settings. Added to the home screen, it keeps
the icon of the look it had then.

A Cloudflare Worker serves the page and reads the WNBA's own feeds on its own,
every 15 seconds during games while the page is open and a little less often
while it isn't, and ESPN's for where each game is on. If the WNBA
stops sending scores, ESPN's stand in.
It also reads the news from ESPN, The Athletic, The IX, Winsidr, and, for the Liberty,
NY Post and NetsDaily, every 15 minutes by day and hourly overnight, and has
Claude keep the stories worth reading and group them by topic. The News tab shows
a card for each topic from the past week, with its lead story and the one that
adds the most, each a headline, a short summary, and who wrote it, linking to the
outlet's site. Settings can leave out the Liberty's own beat writers and The
Athletic, whose stories mostly need a subscription; each device keeps its own.
Saved to an iPhone's home screen, the page opens full screen like an app, and
can send a notification with the score when any playoff game ends.

### Sharing a page

To share either page, give it an access code. Anyone who opens the link types
the code once, and the phone remembers it.

## Setup (for humans)

Open [Claude Code on the web](https://claude.ai/code), paste this prompt, and
follow Claude's instructions.

```
Set up the MLB tracker from https://github.com/kaplanoah/sports-apps
for me. Clone it (branch main), read the "Setup (for Claude Code)"
section of its README, and guide me through it one step at a time.
```

Claude deploys the page to Cloudflare and gives you its private address. It
takes about ten minutes.

**You'll need** a Claude plan that includes Claude Code on the web and a free
[Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) account. Claude walks you
through the Cloudflare part.

Running the page doesn't cost anything. It runs on Cloudflare's free tier, and
the scores come from the leagues' free public feeds. Keeping it updated doesn't use
Claude.

## Setup (for Claude Code)

Guide the user one step at a time. Tell them the one thing to do next, wait
until they say it's done, then go on. Don't ask them to make choices you can
make for them. Never ask for the Cloudflare token in the chat.

Set up the app they asked for, by its folder under `apps/`: `mlb` for the MLB
tracker, `wnba` for the WNBA tracker. Below, `<app>` is that folder, and `<worker>` is the `name`
in its `apps/<app>/worker/wrangler.toml`.

**1. Get this session ready to deploy.** If `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is set
and
`curl -s https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/workers/subdomain`
returns `"success":true`, go to step 2. Otherwise start with something like:
"I'll walk you through adding a few things to this cloud environment so I can
deploy the page for you. If you'd rather deploy it yourself from a terminal,
just let me know." Then go through the steps below. If they want to deploy it
themselves, see "If they deploy it themselves" below.

1. Have them sign in at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
   and open **Workers & Pages**. A free account is fine. If it asks for a
   workers.dev subdomain, have them pick one and tell you what it is.
2. Have them create a token at **Manage Account > API Tokens > Create Token**
   with the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template, scoped to their account.
   Skip IP filtering because cloud sessions don't have a fixed address. A
   one-week expiry is enough. They copy the token but don't paste it into the
   chat.
3. Have them find their **Account ID** in the right-hand column of the
   Workers & Pages overview.
4. In Claude Code, have them open this session's cloud environment (the
   environment menu in the title bar > **Edit**) and set:
   - **API credentials > Add credential**: type Bearer, allowed website
     `api.cloudflare.com`, header `Authorization`, prefix `Bearer`, and the
     token as the value. Then **Connect**. Sessions can use it but can't see
     it.
   - **Environment variables**: `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<their account id>`.
   - **Network access**: Custom. Add `<worker>.<their-subdomain>.workers.dev`
     and keep the default package managers.

   Then **Save changes**.

5. Environment settings only apply to new sessions. Start one in the same
   environment on this repo's `main` with this prompt. Use the
   `create_session` tool if you have it. Otherwise have the user start it.
   `Continue setting up the MLB tracker: README "Setup (for Claude Code)", step 2.`

**2. Deploy the Worker.** Run `npm ci`, then `npm run deploy:api -- <app>`. It
runs the tests, deploys the app from `main` exactly as it is on GitHub, and
checks that the Worker answers. It keeps the Worker's address out of its output, because GitHub's
deploy logs are public; step 3 prints it. It refuses uncommitted changes and anything that isn't `main`'s latest commit.
The session's own branch works once it matches `main`. It sets
`NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` so Node sends its requests through the session's
proxy, which adds the token. That needs Node 22.21 or later. The repo's `.claude/settings.json` has
the user approve that command, and `set-app-key` below, and blocks the other ways to deploy.

**3. Give the page its address.** Run `npm run set-app-key -- <app>`. It gives
the Worker a long random `APP_KEY` secret and prints the page's address,
`https://<worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev/<key>/`. The page and its saved
data answer only there. Give the user the address and tell them to keep it
private: anyone who has it can see and change the page. Never pass
`--rotate` unless they ask. It replaces the key, which changes the address.

To share the page beyond the user, have them pick an access code and run
`npm run set-access-code -- <app> <code>`. The page then asks for it before it
opens, and each phone types it once. Case, spaces, and hyphens don't count.
Running it again with a new code signs every phone out until it types the new
one, and `--remove` stops asking. Never commit or post the code.

The WNBA's news needs an Anthropic API key, as the Worker's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
secret. Have the user add it themselves in the Cloudflare dashboard (the Worker's
**Settings**, then **Variables and Secrets**, as a **Secret**), never in chat.
Without it, the Worker still reads the feeds but keeps no story.
`<address>store/news/status` says what the last run couldn't do, and counts
Claude's calls and tokens by day.

**4. Check the page.** Have the user open the address. The first visit also
starts the Worker's own updates. Then read `<address>store/live/status` with
`curl`. If `data.error` and `data.write` are empty, it works. If not, `error`
says why the Worker couldn't read the league, and `write` names the save that failed.

**5. Save it to the home screen.** On an iPhone, have them open the address
in Safari and choose **Share > Add to Home Screen**. It then opens full
screen with its own icon. On a phone, the page shows these steps itself, in a
bar across the top until it's closed and at the bottom of settings, and on
Android its **Install** button opens Chrome's own install dialog.

**6. Turn on notifications.** From the home screen icon, have them tap the
sliders at the top right to open settings, turn on **Notifications**, and allow
them.
iPhones send web notifications only to pages opened from the home screen.
Each device turns them on for itself. A notification comes for each new
update about a team in the ranking: a postseason game or series result, a
clinch, an elimination, or a change in the field or seeds.

Finish by telling the user they can set their ranking in settings, below
Notifications. If they made a Cloudflare token only for this setup, tell them
they can delete it now, or remove the environment credential. The page keeps running without it.
To deploy future changes on merge instead, see "Deploying on merge" below.

### If they deploy it themselves

Assume they're comfortable in a terminal. In their own clone of `main` they
run `npx wrangler login`, then `npm run build -- <app>` and
`npx wrangler deploy --config apps/<app>/worker/wrangler.toml`, which prints the
Worker's address. Then they give it a key with `npx wrangler secret put APP_KEY`,
pasting a long random value such as the output of
`node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(24).toString('base64url'))"`.
The page's address is the Worker's address plus `/<key>/`. Then go on from
step 4. They redeploy with the same two commands when the code changes.

Deploying from Cloudflare's dashboard isn't covered here, because the page's
saved data needs the Durable Object binding and migration that
`apps/<app>/worker/wrangler.toml` sets up. Cloudflare's tools change over time, so if
something doesn't match, point them to Cloudflare's
[Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

## Making changes

`main` is what's deployed. Work on a branch and open a pull request into
`main`. GitHub lints, checks formatting and types, looks for unused code, and
runs the tests, in Node and in a browser, on every pull request, so merge once
those pass and the pull request has no conflicts with `main`. If the repo has a
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret, Claude also reviews
every push to a pull request, comments on bugs, rule breaks, security problems,
and missing tests, and keeps one summary comment up to date. The review is one
of the checks that must pass, so a review that can't run blocks the merge. Its
findings don't fail the check; answer each one by fixing it or replying. To run the
same checks yourself, run `npm ci` and `npx playwright install chromium` once,
then `npm run check`. `npm run format` fixes formatting.

Each app's Worker carries its page. Every deploy bundles both from the source it
deploys, so there is nothing to rebuild by hand. `npm run build` writes each
app's bundle to its `apps/<app>/worker/dist/`, which git ignores, if you want to
look at it. The bundle records its version, the commit it was built from, and
when, and the page's settings show them.

Code every app uses lives in `shared/`: the type scale every page's text keeps
to (`type.css`), the page's tab bar and settings sheet
and the bar that asks a phone to add the page to the Home Screen (their styles
in `chrome.css`), the sheet a tap on a game opens (`sheet.css`),
catching up on return, showing what the page last showed while it loads, and
store client in
`shared/page/`, and the Worker's routing and push
notifications in `shared/worker/`. A change there reaches every app. The root
`worker/` holds the tooling every app shares: building, versioning, deploying,
and setting the page's key. Tests for shared code and tooling are in the root
`tests/`; each app's own tests are in its `tests/`.

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Each pull request's
title starts with a type: `feat:` for a new feature, `fix:`, `refactor:`, or
`build:` for a patch, and `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, or `chore:` for changes that
don't deploy. A `!` after a type that deploys, as in `feat!:`, marks a major
change for every app it deploys; `feat(mlb)!:` makes it major for that app
alone, and the others take the type's own bump. The build works out each app's
version from these titles on `main`, so there are no tags to keep. A merge that
changes nothing an app's deploy counts, like only its tests, docs, or other
apps' folders, leaves that app's version alone. Each app counts on from a
baseline version in `worker/release.mjs`; a new app starts at 1.0.0 with the
merge that adds its folder.

Every deploy checks that the Worker answers afterward. If it doesn't, the
deploy puts the previous version back and fails. An open page reloads itself
for a deploy the next time it comes back into view, and otherwise reads what
changed while it was away, so a home-screen app never needs quitting to catch
up. A page that loads again first shows what it last showed, so it doesn't
flash empty while it waits for its data.

### Deploying on merge

GitHub can deploy each app's Worker, page included, after each merge: at once
when the pull request's checks passed on exactly the code `main` now has, which
is when it was up to date with `main` as it merged, and otherwise once the
checks pass on `main`. In the repo's **Settings > Environments**, create an
environment named `production`, limit its deployment branches to `main` and
`beta` (see "Trying a change on the phone" below), and add:

- a secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: a Cloudflare token made from the **Edit
  Cloudflare Workers** template, with no IP filtering and a long expiry;
- a secret `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, so it stays out of the public deploy logs.

Each deploy records its commit on the Worker's version. A merge skips an app's
deploy when nothing but docs, tests, tooling, and other apps' folders changed
since its live version's commit, since its Worker would be the same;
`worker/deploy-scope.mjs` lists those files. A merge that main has already moved past skips too, since
the newer merge's deploy covers it. Without the token, merges deploy nothing.
Redeploy by hand with `npm run deploy:api`, or `npm run deploy:api -- <app>` for
one app. `npm run rollback -- <app>` puts the app's previous version back at all
of its traffic and prints which commit was live and which is now; it refuses
when there's no earlier version. A rollback keeps the Worker's secrets as they
are.

### Trying a change on the phone

Each app also has a beta Worker, `<app>-app-beta`, named in the `[env.beta]` of
its `wrangler.toml`, with its own store, key, and address. Its page names itself
"beta" on the Home Screen and in its settings' version line, so it can sit beside
the real one. To use a pull request's change on the phone before it merges:

1. Reset `beta` to the pull request's branch and push it:
   `git push -f origin <branch>:beta`.
2. Wait for the Deploy run for that push to finish. It deploys the beta Workers
   at once, with the same checks and rollback as `main`'s deploy.
3. Open the beta app from the Home Screen and use the change.

Before the first beta deploy, allow the `beta` branch in the `production`
environment's deployment branches. After the first one, give each beta Worker
its key with `npm run set-app-key -- <app> --channel beta`, which prints its
address, and, if the real page asks for a code, set one with
`npm run set-access-code -- <app> <code> --channel beta`. Add the page to the
Home Screen from that address. `npm run deploy:api -- <app> --channel beta`
deploys beta by hand, from a checkout of `origin/beta`, and
`npm run rollback -- <app> --channel beta` rolls it back.
